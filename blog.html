    <h1>Managing a team of Brazilians</h1>
    <p class="intro">Starting a company is hard. Building a team might be even harder. I recently had the opportunity to have a hand in both. This is what I learned.</p>
    <p>This, like many of our other traditional perceptions of digital and interactive experiences, are either changing or being <a>replaced</a> altogether as we enter the post-PC era. New devices have such high resolution displays that individual pixels become imperceptibly small. Other devices, like the Amazon Kindle, eschew pixels altogether — opting to use electronic ink.<br/></p>
    <p class="pullquote">These new devices are radically transforming what is possible in digital visual design and this has radical implications for digital typography. </p>
    <p>The death of the pixel leaves you with a flowing, magazine-quality canvas to design for. A canvas where curves are curves, not ugly pixel approximations of curves. A canvas that begins to blur the line between what we consider to be real and what we consider to be virtual.</p>
    <h3>tesla was right</h3>
    <p>It wasn't too long ago that there was one set of rules for use of type on print and use of type on screen. Now that we have screens that are essentially print quality, we have to reevaluate these conventions.</p>
    <p> Web sites are transforming from boring fields of Arial to embrace the gamut of typographical possibilities offered by web fonts. Web fonts, combined with the style and layout options presented by the creative use of CSS and JavaScript offer a new world of typographic opportunity on the web. </p>
    <h2>Fire early</h2>
    <p>Web fonts allow for a wider palette of typefaces which can provide far more quirkiness and personality.</p>
    <p>The challenge is to help people understand this. The classics such as Arial, Helvetica, Verdana or Tahoma are engrained as fonts you will always expect to see; readers aren't used to seeing type choices beyond these usual suspects.</p>
    <h2>Find out what motivates your team</h2>
    <p>Foodies around the world know of Jamie Oliver’s passion for using locally-sourced, farm-to-table ingredients. <a>Jamie's Italian</a> has opened in Yorkdale and is where his team brings his philosophy to life, using locally grown products for his delectable menu.<br/></p>
    <p>If you think we’re done, we’re not. We just ran out of room to list everything. Toronto really has it all, from authentic ethnic joints, to fusion that will make your mouth water. The diversity in Toronto is not just limited to its people, it’s found in its food scene, world-renowned events and nightlife. There truly is <a>something</a> for everyone.</p>
    <h2> Owners Innovate. Period.</h2>

    <p class="pullquote">I had to figure out what the fuck I was doing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first item in an unordered list</li>
      <li>Second item right here</li>
      <li>This is the third item in the list</li>
